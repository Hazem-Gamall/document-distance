  This story takes place in its own universe. It has no
  connection to any of the DC films that have come before it.

  We see it as a classic Warner Bros. movie. Gritty, intimate
  and oddly funny, the characters live in the real world and
  the stakes are personal.

  Although it is never mentioned in the film, this story takes
  place in the past.

  Let's call it 1981.

  It's a troubled time. The crime rate in Gotham is at record
  highs. A garbage strike has crippled the city for the past
  six weeks. And the divide between the "haves" and the "have-
  nots" is palpable. Dreams are beyond reach, slipping into
  delusions.



                                                      OVER BLACK:

    HEAR LAUGHTER.

    The sound of a man totally cracking up.

                                                        FADE IN:


1   INT. DEPT. OF HEALTH, OFFICE - MORNING                          1

    CLOSE ON JOKER (30's), tears in his eyes from laughing so
    hard. He's trying to get it under control. His greasy, black
    hair is matted down. He's wearing an old, faded red hooded
    zip-up sweatshirt, a threadbare gray scarf, thin from years
    of use, hangs loosely around his neck.

    WE NOTICE TWO FADED OLD SCARS cut at the corners of his
    mouth. Almost forming a smile.

    He's sitting across from an overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50's),
    African American. Her office is cramped and run-down in a
    cramped and run-down building. Stacks of folders piled high
    in front of her.

    She just sits behind her desk, waiting for his laughing fit
    to end, she's been through this before. Finally it subsides.

    Joker takes a deep breath, pauses to see if it's over.

    Beat.

                        JOKER
              --is it just me, or is it getting
              crazier out there?

    Despite the laughter, there's real pain in his eyes.
    Something broken in him. Looks like he hasn't slept in days.

                         SOCIAL WORKER
              It's certainly tense. People are
              upset, they're struggling. Looking
              for work. The garbage strike seems
              like it's been going on forever.
              These are tough times.
                  (then)
              How 'bout you. How's the job? Still
              enjoying it?

                          JOKER
              Yeah, I   mean, it's different each
              day, so   I really like that. I don't
              think I   could ever work in an
              office.   Behind a desk.
                          (MORE)
                                                         2.

                     JOKER (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          No offense.

She smiles. Writes something down. Looks at the clock, she's
running late for her next appointment.

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Have you been keeping up with your
          journal?

                       JOKER
          Everyday.

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Great. Did you bring it with you?

Beat.

                    JOKER
              (dodging the subject)
          I'm sorry. Did I bring what?

                    SOCIAL WORKER
              (impatient; she doesn't
               have time for this)
          Arthur, last time I asked you to
          bring your journal with you. For
          these appointments. Do you have it?

                       JOKER
          Yes ma'am.

Beat.

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Can I see it?

He reluctantly reaches into his bag. Pulls out a weathered
notebook. Slides it across to her--

                    JOKER
          I've been using it as a journal,
          but also a joke diary. Funny
          thoughts or, or observations-- Did
          I tell you I'm pursuing a career in
          stand-up comedy?

She's half-listening as she flips through his journal.

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          No. You didn't.

                    JOKER
          I think I did.
                                                            3.


She doesn't respond, keeps flipping through his journal--

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Oh yeah. Because of what your
          mother said,-- about your purpose.
          "To bring laughter and joy to the
          world," right?

                    JOKER
          Right.

ANGLE ON JOURNAL, pages and pages of notes, all in neat,
angry-looking handwriting. Also, cut out photos from hardcore
pornographic magazines and some crude handmade drawings.

A flash of anger crosses Joker's face. We see him picking at
his right eyebrow, almost obsessively. Trying to stay calm.
His eyebrow is actually half-gone. Something he does a lot.

                    JOKER
          I didn't realize you wanted to read
          it.

The social worker gives him a look, then reads something in
the pages that gives her pause.

                    SOCIAL WORKER
              (reading out loud)
          "I just hope my death makes more
          sense than my life."

She looks up at Joker. He just stares back. Lets it hang out
there for a beat.

Then he laughs a little, even though he doesn't think it's
funny--

                    JOKER
          Yeah. I mean, that's just--

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Does my reading it upset you?

He leans in.

                    JOKER
          No. I just,-- some of it's
          personal. You know?

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          I understand. I just want to make
          sure you're keeping up with it.

She slides his journal back to him. He holds it in his lap.
                                                         4.


                    SOCIAL WORKER
          What about your mom? How's she
          feeling?

                    JOKER
          She has good days. But mostly bad.
          It's been a big help having me
          there. She really needs me.

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Seems like she's been sick a lot
          since you got home.

                     JOKER
              (nods)
          Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I
          was in the hospital, after my last
          episode-- she was having trouble
          getting over there to visit.

She looks back up at the clock, she needs to get to her next
appointment.

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          All right. So, I'll see you again,
          two weeks from today?

He nods. But keeps sitting there for a moment.

She stands up, trying to signal it's time for him to leave--

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Is there something else I can help
          you with, Arthur? My next
          appointment is waiting.

He just keeps sitting there.

                    JOKER
          Yeah, I was wondering if you could
          ask the doctor to increase the
          dosage on my medications? Nothing
          seems to make a difference.

                     SOCIAL WORKER
              (looking over his record)
          Do you know which ones you'd like
          increased?

Shakes his head, no.

                    SOCIAL WORKER
          Have you been sleeping?
                                                              5.


                        JOKER
                  (lying)
              Some.

    She glances at his file again.

                        SOCIAL WORKER
              Arthur, you're on seven different
              medications. Surely they must be
              doing something.

    He finally stands up. Zips up his faded red sweatshirt.

    Looks at her--

                        JOKER
              I just don't wanna feel so bad
              anymore.

                                                  CUT TO BLACK:

    TITLE:

                                JOKER


2   EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE, MIDTOWN - KENNY'S MUSIC SHOP - DAY         2

    GOTHAM SQUARE IS CLOGGED WITH TRAFFIC. Non-stop honking
    horns, pedestrians crowding the sidewalk. Huge billboards,
    giant movie marquees, garbage bags piled high everywhere.
    Underneath it all we hear a TINKLING PIANO playing something
    bouncy and fast-paced.

    FROM ACROSS THE BUSY CITY STREET, we see Joker. He's dressed
    as a sad-faced HOBO CLOWN. This is his job.

    Dressed in tattered clothes, dark five o'clock shadow painted
    on his face, big bulbous red nose, his mouth's outlined in
    white, turned down at the corners.

    He's holding up a sign in front of Kenny's Music Shop that
    reads, "EVERYTHING MUST GO!" A banner above the store reads,
    "GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!" Behind him, an OLD MAN plays a piano
    on the street. Both of them there to draw attention to the
    big sale going on in the store.

    Joker's doing a little Charlie Chaplin like waddle to the
    music. Most people walk right past, ignoring him. A few bump
    into him by mistake.

    JOKER SEES A GROUP OF FIVE BOYS, no more than 15-years-old,
    walking toward him. He moves out of their way. They crack up
    laughing when they see him. Start making fun of him.
                                                                6.


    Joker ignores them, tries to do his job the best he can while
    maintaining some dignity. Keeps dancing and holding up the
    sign.

    One of the kids knocks the sign out of Joker's hands--

                        KID #1
              Suck my dick, clown.

    The kids laugh. Joker doesn't say anything. Just bends over
    to pick up the sign--

    Another kid kicks him in the ass--

                        KID #2
              Whoops.

    Joker falls face first onto the sidewalk. Oddly, the old man
    playing the piano picks up the pace of the music--

    The kids crack up. One of the boys grabs Joker's sign and
    takes off running across the street--

    The other kids follow, weaving through traffic--
