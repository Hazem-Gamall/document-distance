     -FIRE.    NOTHING BUT FIRE.

2    INT. TIGHT SPACE - INDETERMINATE TIME                           2

     Dark and cramped. The soft red light of fire seeps through
     iron slats. Inside this cage is a man, bound by chains.

     It's THOR. His beard is long and his clothes are worn. That
     rough, grizzled look of a man who's spent years on the road.

     He awakens with a JOLT.   Looks around.

                           THOR
                 Now I know what you're thinking.
                 Oh no! Thor's in a cage. How did
                 this happen?
                     (then:)
                 Well, sometimes you have to get
                 captured just to get a straight
                 answer out of somebody. It's a long
                 story but basically I'm a bit of a
                 hero. See, I spent some time on
                 earth, fought some robots, saved
                 the planet a couple of times. Then
                 I went searching through the cosmos
                 for some magic, colorful Infinity
                 Stone things... didn't find any.
                 That's when I came across a path of
                 death and destruction which led me
                 all the way here into this cage...
                 where I met you.

     Reveal that he's talking to a weird alien skeleton in chains.

                           THOR (CONT'D)
                 How much longer do you think we'll
                 be here?

     NOISE.    Sounds of metal gears TURNING.

     Suddenly the bottom DROPS OUT! Thor PLUMMETS until - SHLINK!
     Chains CINCH and abruptly halt his descent. Thor dangles six
     feet off the ground. Pull back to reveal we are in-

3   INT. SURTUR'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS                                  3

    A cavernous space. The walls, floors, and ceilings are
    molten rock, which has creepy glimmers of fire within it.
    Stationed in the center is a volcanic rock throne, and
    sitting in that throne is a charred demonic skeleton.

                        SURTUR (O.S.)
              Thor, Son of Odin.

    Thor's chain turns to reveal-

    -SURTUR on his throne. Eighteen-feet-tall, flesh made of
    fire, and demonic spiked horns on his skull.

                         THOR
              Surtur. Son of a bitch...you're
              still alive! I thought my father
              killed you, like, half a million
              years ago.

                        SURTUR
              I cannot die. Not until I fulfill
              my destiny and lay waste to your
              home.

                        THOR
              You know, it's funny you should
              mention that because I've been
              having these terrible dreams of
              late. Asgard up in flames, falling
              to ruins, and you Surtur are at the
              center of all of them.

                        SURTUR
              Then you have seen Ragnarok, the
              fall of Asgard. The great prophecy--

                         THOR (O.S.)
              Hang on.   Hang on.

    Reveal that Thor's chain is turning VERY SLOWLY.

                        THOR (CONT'D)
              I'll be back around shortly. I
              really feel like we were connecting
              there.

    After a beat, Thor rotates around to face Surtur.

                        THOR (CONT'D)
              Okay, so, Ragnarok. Tell me about
              that. Walk me through it.
                       BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16           3.


                    SURTUR
          My time has come. When my crown is
          reunited with the Eternal Flame, I
          shall be restored to my full might.
          I will tower over the mountains and
          bury my sword deep in Asgard's--

                    THOR
